# Hey, I’m Abi 👋

🎓 Student trying to figure out this whole dev thing  
Mostly vibing with backend stuff, but honestly open to wherever the wind takes me 🌬️

## 🚧 What I’m Up To Right Now

- 🌱 Where I’m At

---

## 🧰 Tools I Mess Around With

- **Backend:** Laravel, PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL (and a bit of others)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (when forced to 😔)  
- **Misc:** Git, VS Code, vibes only ✨

---

## 📦 Projects

Here’s some stuff I’ve thrown together:

- Experimenting with different ideas to see what clicks  
- Learning by breaking things and fixing them again  
- Documenting the chaotic journey of being a student dev

*(Detailed project breakdown coming when I figure out what I actually want to do 👀)*

## 🌱 Vibe Check

Not here to flex skills I don’t have.  
Just experimenting, learning, and seeing what sticks.

If you’ve got cool project ideas or want to chat about backend stuff, feel free to say hi 🤝

*Come back when I’ve figured out my life path* 😶‍🌫️
